      <description>This year I&amp;rsquo;m looking at either starting, continuing, or contributing to the below projects. Some are ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve kicked around with a few mates, others there&amp;rsquo;s definitely an industry gap I&amp;rsquo;d like to fill, and then others are just experimenting with something cool.
No real priorities, so please let me know what you&amp;rsquo;re interested in!
I&amp;rsquo;m also available for consulting, so feel free to email me if you&amp;rsquo;d like to work together.</description>

What&amp;rsquo;s this about? I&amp;rsquo;ve met a lot of damn smart people in the InfoSec space. Pen-testers, Architects, Engineers, you name it! Despite all of these talented people working hard to solve REAL problems, the same issues continue to crop up:</description>
