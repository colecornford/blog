      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of dropped off the face of the internet for the last month or so. The reason is that I was preparing for an on-site interview with a big technology company in the USA. That company was Facebook.
I was approached by a FB recruiter on LinkedIn and even though i felt that I had no chance with the company, I went ahead with the process anyway.
See, I felt that I could make a big difference to billions of people worldwide by working there.</description>

      <description>I was laying on my lounge for New Years Eve 2018 (boring i know hey?).
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad, I was watching my favourite MTG Streamer playing Sorin&amp;rsquo;s Vengeance + Twincast, a beautiful&amp;hellip; if not infuriating combination of magic cards.
I had realised I had gone through 2018 without terribly many technical achievements in work and life. Sure, I had learned a huge amount from my amazing colleagues. But it seemed like for that time period, I&amp;rsquo;d just gained an extra notch on my LinkedIn profile.</description>
