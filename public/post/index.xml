      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Australia or Britain you&amp;rsquo;ve probably come across this beauty. Chewy, tasty, and featuring an awesome lattice shape it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty awesome chocolate bar friends! 3.5 stars.
But this blog&amp;rsquo;s about AppSec not rating choccies so let&amp;rsquo;s get back on track. While chewing on one of these goodies I thought, hey, why not write about curl, a program that I&amp;rsquo;ve found absolutely essential for getting my automated DevSecOps pipelines up and running.</description>

      <description>I was laying on my lounge for New Years Eve 2018 (boring i know hey?).
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that bad, I was watching my favourite MTG Streamer playing Sorin&amp;rsquo;s Vengeance + Twincast, a beautiful&amp;hellip; if not infuriating combination of magic cards.
I had realised I had gone through 2018 without terribly many technical achievements in work and life. Sure, I had learned a huge amount from my amazing colleagues. But it seemed like for that time period, I&amp;rsquo;d just gained an extra notch on my LinkedIn profile.</description>

      <title>2019 Frontend Framework Security</title>
      <link>https://www.colecornford.com/post/2019-03-06-framework-sec/</link>

      <description>My friend Wesley asked this question to me. Modern development has so many options available to pick from, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit bewildering to be frank.
But, I think that regardless of which frontend framework that you use, the same security vulnerabilities that have existed for a number of years will be cropping up.
The good news is that there are less ways to do stuff badly, the frameworks try to push people towards more secure options.</description>
