<p>I was laying on my lounge for New Years Eve 2018 (boring i know hey?).</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that bad, I was watching my favourite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg1tU3i6z52tAZunIPhCS4w">MTG Streamer</a> playing Sorin&rsquo;s Vengeance + Twincast, a beautiful&hellip; if not infuriating combination of magic cards.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/posts/2019-mar3-sorin.jpg" alt="Disgusting Combo" /></p>

<p>I had realised I had gone through 2018 without terribly many technical achievements in work and life. Sure, I had learned an amazing amount from my wonderful colleagues like Farooq, Nina, and Stefano. But it seemed like for that time period, I&rsquo;d just gained an extra notch on my LinkedIn profile. I didn&rsquo;t have much to show for all the amazing things I had learned and studied throughout the year.</p>

<h2 id="cool-guys-inc">Cool Guys Inc</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been part of a slack server for a few years.  One of my close friends decided to leave facebook  and asked all of us to join his slack server. It&rsquo;s been a good mix of dev and security chat, cooking discussions, and pokemon memes.</p>

<p>All of which would probably make for good blog topics, so I figured, hey, maybe I should give that a go. I also kind of wanted to deal with a few other little things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buying my personal domain before some arsehat takes it</li>
<li>More opportunities to work on my technical and personal writing skills again</li>
<li>Keep a non-git repository of awesome resources and things I&rsquo;m learning/doing/have done.</li>
<li>A portfolio to show for future work opportunities</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I spoke with my friends at Cool Guys Inc and they all said go for it!</p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start?</h2>

<p>First thing I went about was reviewing what my other colleagues had experience with, what the industry was trending towards, and what I&rsquo;d be most comfortable using.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefano-parini-61ba6229/">Stefano</a> was writing Blog Posts on LinkedIn (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/application-security-program-simple-easy-stefano-parini/">they&rsquo;re</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/application-security-program-information-noise-stefano-parini/">really</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/application-security-program-volume-velocity-stefano-parini/">good!</a>) and noticed he wasn&rsquo;t getting as much traction as he liked. So decided early on that it probably wasn&rsquo;t the platform for me. I feel i would have my posts get lost in the cacophony of voices marketing jobs and random InfoSec products/services/training.</p>

<p>So figured, maybe another managed service would be a good idea? Medium seemed to be the next option, but I felt that it was too constrained to being a blogging platform exclusively and I wouldn&rsquo;t have the ability to do customisation as I would have liked. Ditto on the noise factor.</p>

<p>I investigated Ghost as I came across an <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/its-a-new-blog/">article by Troy Hunt</a> that talked about how great he found the platform to be. The issue is that I wanted to avoid paying for anything initially, in fact if i could avoid paying at all that would be best. And I&rsquo;m not the best Infrastructure expert, I&rsquo;d rather not have to manage my own server and deal with patching and certificates and such if possible.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-left">What&rsquo;s left?</h2>

<p>So I went back to watching magic streams for a little while and learning about golang, my new pet language. I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM">this amazing talk</a> by Rob Pike one of the language designers of golang, and something just twigged in me.</p>

<p>The golang designers picked three absolutely critical principles that they stuck by when designing the language, why shouldn&rsquo;t I do the same?</p>

<h2 id="following-the-principles">Following the Principles</h2>

<p>I came up with the following set of principles</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Free</strong>: My website needs to absorb as little money AND time from me for maintenance as possible, so I can focus on learning, writing, and personal  projects.</p>

<p><strong>Modern</strong>: My website needs to be accessible, clean, and easily to use. My users expect modern blog platform features, integration with socials, and responsive design.</p>

<p><strong>Secure</strong>: My website needs to be secure. If I am preaching security, and not actively securing my website, then I have no grounds to talk about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given these principles it became a lot clearer what met my needs. Here are a few cliff-notes that i took in Sublime while researching my options.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
<li>Wordpress

<ul>
<li>Could host myself, but that&rsquo;ll eat time and money. Known to be bad at security. Little dated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tumblr

<ul>
<li>Can&rsquo;t post sexy pics of myself on this. :( Also I doubt my audience would be using Tumblr, or that I would be taken seriously if I used it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>LinkedIn

<ul>
<li>Sites got my audience, but nobody will find posts without sifting through the garbage. Limited control over my own direction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Jekyll

<ul>
<li>Static Site so definitely more secure, no infra since hosted in GitHub Pages, Sleek, uses Ruby for generation though so bleh.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gatsby

<ul>
<li>Static like Jekyll, seems very feature-rich. I don&rsquo;t need a billion features, and more features adds bloat. I&rsquo;m not great at React.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hugo

<ul>
<li>Static, can host on github, written in golang. Seems well-supported, is very fast.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Medium

<ul>
<li>Definitely the mature blogging platform, but definitely purpose built for blogging, and I&rsquo;d like to have a little more control. Also, same issue with LinkedIn, noise is common.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ghost

<ul>
<li>Cost in time and $$$ for management. Investigated it a bit, its nodeJS so super fast, but not quite what I&rsquo;m looking for.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-winner-is-hugo">The winner is HUGO</h2>

<p>I pretty much narrowed it down to ONLY static site generators, and from there Hugo was easily better for my purposes than Jekyll as I&rsquo;m used to the go syntax over Ruby, and know that golang is far better performance-wise than Ruby is.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think that&rsquo;s enough for my first blog post. In my next one I&rsquo;ll talk about some of the reasons behind theming, social media choices, website language, etc.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
