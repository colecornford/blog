![What are some key framework security features](../../img/posts/2019-mar6-wes.PNG)

My friend Wesley asked this question to me. Modern  development has so many options available to pick from, it's a bit bewildering to be frank.

But, I think that regardless of which frontend framework that you use, the same security vulnerabilities that have existed for a number of years will be cropping up.

The good news is that there are _less_ ways to do stuff badly, the frameworks try to push people towards more secure options.

A good example is 

### React.JS
What is 

### Vue.JS
### Angular
### TypeScript
### Foundation

## Backend

### nodeJS
### Django
### Laravel
### ASP.Net
### Spring
### GraphQL
