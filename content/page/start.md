### Who am I?

![me](../../img/me.jpg)
**_Welcome friends_**! I'm Cole, an AppSec professional who can't stop speaking when I get put on a stage. If you've got an interest in InfoSec and personal development then I hope you find the things I write about the to be valuable to you!

### What's this about?

I've met a lot of damn smart people in the InfoSec space. Pen-testers, Architects, Engineers, you name it! Despite all of these talented people working hard to solve **REAL** problems, the same issues continue to crop up:

* Adversaries know our applications and networks better than we do
* We're playing cat and mouse constantly, putting in controls that are already aged when they go-live
* It seems no matter how much education we provide users we still get plenty of clicks on [phishing](/evil) links constantly.
* and plenty more...

If you're seeing this, then you might feel that the future isn't particularly bright for InfoSec. We're living in a very fast-paced time, and the challenges we encounter are not easy to solve by any means.

It just proves that we absolutely need to _flip_ our current approaches to InfoSec.  My mission is to give people the tools, knowledge, and vision to change how their organisations approach InfoSec.
