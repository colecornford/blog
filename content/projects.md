This year I'm looking at either starting, continuing, or contributing to the below projects. Some are ideas I've kicked around with a few mates, others there's definitely an industry gap I'd like to fill, and then others are just experimenting with something cool.

No real priorities, so please let me know what you're interested in!

I'm also **available for consulting**, so feel free to  <a href="mailto:cole.cornford@gmail.com?subject='Hello! I'm interested in training!">email me</a> if you'd like to work together.
